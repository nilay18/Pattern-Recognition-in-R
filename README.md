# Pattern-Recognition-in-R

Train all the machine learning models using sample dataset in R language on R-Studio:

## Models/Concepts:
1.Linear Discriminant Functions
2.Regularization
3.Neural Networks
4.Deep Learning
5.Support Vector Machines
6.Decision Trees
7.Ensemble Methods
8.Clustering
9.Non-metric: Association Rules and Collaborative Filtering
10.Text Retrieval

Commands to train and demonstrate each model/concept have been listed sequentially with necessary information of its use and function is documented

Please feel free to play with seed values and other initilization values before training the model.
